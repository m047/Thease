What is the difference between git and github?
- Git is a tool to manage versioning. Github is a website to host repositories and their versions
Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
- Easy to incorporate new features by creating a new version and merging afterwards without endangering already working code
- Easy to work together in groups (on different versions)
- Easy to rollback to previous versions when necessary
Name 3 alternatives to git:
- SVN
- Azure DevOps
- Helix Core
Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
- Git doesn't save all files but just the differences/changes from version to version
- A git user usually has a local repository and pushes to the remote (shared) repository
Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
- Some files can't be merged directly, e.g. a scene in Unity can't really be merged by git
- Some files in games are very large and make the repository grow
