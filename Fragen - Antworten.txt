What is the difference between git and github?
- Git is a tool to manage versioning. Github is a website to host repositories and their versions
Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
- Easy to incorporate new features by creating a new version and merging afterwards without endangering already working code
- Easy to work together in groups (on different versions)
- Easy to rollback to previous versions when necessary
Name 3 alternatives to git:
- SVN
- Azure DevOps
- Helix Core
Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
- Git doesn't save all files but just the differences/changes from version to version
- A git user usually has a local repository and pushes to the remote (shared) repository
Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
- Some files can't be merged directly, e.g. a scene in Unity can't really be merged by git
- Some files in games are very large and make the repository grow


Describe a logging system with your own words:
A logging system is a system to write important information on the behaviour, successes and failures of the program to a file or the console.
What is the difference between git submodules and git subtrees?
- Submodules are a link to another module, so use it if you don't intend to change anything and want to have the newest version when it updates
- Subtrees are a copy of another module, so use it if you intend to change the module and don't want to get the new versions automatically
What is a build system in C++? Name 3 build systems:
A build system combines dependencies and pre-/post-buildsteps to simplify the process of building a project.
- Make
- CMake
- Premake
What is a package manager in C++? Name 3 package manager:
A package manager takes care of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing packages.
- vcpkg
- Conan
- build2


What is the difference between a dynamic linked library and a static library?
A dynamic linked library is accessed during runtime to find the used functions. A static library is incorporated in the compiled code and will always be there at runtime.
Describe a logging system with your own words:
A logging system is a system that tracks important information on events happening during runtime and writes it to file(s). It should be accessible from all parts of the engine.
What is a Design Pattern?
A design pattern is a standard way to deal with a recurring problem or challenge. It shows an architecture and interfaces of classes.
Name and describe 2 Design Patterns (except faÃ§ade or adapter):
- Observer: There's an observer and observables. The observer will save a collection of observables and implement a callback function. The observable implements a notifyAll function, that notifies all its observers.
- Singleton: This pattern garantuees that the Singleton is the only object of that class, i.e. there can't be other objects of that class. This is done by creating a static reference in the class that always references the only object. The constructor is private and a static method either returns the reference or creates the object accordingly.

What is a precompiled header? Name pros and cons:
A precompiled header is a file that combines lots of imports and is only recompiled when it changes.
Pros:
- Saves compilation time
- Saves time writing code, because you only have to include the pch file
Cons:
- Dependency rot -> it's hard to tell what each file depends on exactly; code might be hard to reuse without including all of it
- Can be slower when used in small projects
Describe the layer of abstraction with your own words:
When you're using an external library, you should put an abstraction layer in front of it. This means that you are implementing an interface, that controls all interaction of your Code and the library. This helps when you later want to replace the library because you only have to edit your abstraction layer.
Name the SOLID principles and describe them briefly:
